# Program with Unit Template

Created on {{DATE}} by {{USER}}

## Description

This template demonstrates modular Pascal programming by creating:
- A main program file (`main.lpr`)
- A separate unit file (`myunit.pas`) with reusable functions
- Proper unit interface and implementation sections

## Files Structure

- `main.lpr`: Main program that uses the custom unit
- `myunit.pas`: Custom unit with public procedures and functions
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Features Demonstrated

- Unit creation with interface and implementation sections
- Public procedure and function declarations
- Using custom units in main program
- Template variable substitution

## How to Build and Run

1. Build using the debug configuration
2. Run the compiled executable
3. The program will demonstrate calling functions from the custom unit

## Learning Points

- How to create and use Pascal units
- Separating interface from implementation
- Code organization and modularity
- Template-based project creation
