# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Program with Unit

Created on {{DATE}} by {{USER}}

## Description

The {{PROJECT_NAME}} project demonstrates modular Pascal programming by creating:
- A main program file (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}.lpr`)
- A separate unit file (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}unit.pas`) with reusable functions
- Proper unit interface and implementation sections

## Files Structure

- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}.lpr`: Main program that uses the custom unit
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}unit.pas`: Custom unit with public procedures and functions
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Features Demonstrated

- Unit creation with interface and implementation sections
- Public procedure and function declarations
- Using custom units in main program
- Template variable substitution with project name

## How to Build and Run

1. Build using the debug or release configuration
2. Run the compiled executable: `out/{{PROJECT_NAME}}`
3. The program will demonstrate calling functions from the custom unit

## Learning Points

- How to create and use Pascal units
- Separating interface from implementation
- Code organization and modularity
- Template-based project creation with dynamic naming
